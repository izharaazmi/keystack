# Chrome Pass Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels) 
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create these icons using any image editor or online icon generator. The icons should represent a key or lock symbol to match the password management theme.

For now, you can use placeholder icons or create simple colored squares with the text "CP" (Chrome Pass) as a temporary solution.
